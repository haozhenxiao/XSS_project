**Background**

An RBS (Radio base station) is a distributed system of components that communicate using messages. A benefit of a distributed system is that it can provide service even though some components fail. Verifying that the system is robust is not trivial as components are stateful, have complex protocols and are built by different teams in a large organization. Netflix is a distributed system that has a component called ChaosMonkey which is designed to introduce failures into the system. The idea is; in order to make sure Netflix can handle failures then letâ€™s fail all the time. Our question is; what are the requirements on a distributed system in order to be verified to work in the presence of failures using ChaosMonkey? We are interested to learn if ChaosMonkey testing (CMT) can help at macro level (RBS) and at micro level (a team developing a component).
